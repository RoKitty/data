# RoKitty Data
**If you don't know what RoKitty is, please see <website>!**  
This repository contains data that RoKitty uses for certain features.  
In general RoKitty fetches data on the client, however for some large sets of data fetching on the client is impractical, so it is stored here instead. 
In the interest of transparency, the data and the code used to generate it is available publicly in this repo.
