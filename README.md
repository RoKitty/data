# RoKitty Data
**If you don't know what RoKitty is, please see https://rokitty.jmk.gg!**  
This repository contains data that RoKitty uses for certain internal features.  
In general, RoKitty fetches data on the client, however for some large sets of data it would be inefficient to fetch it locally so it is stored here instead. 
In the interest of transparency, the data and the code used to generate it is available publicly in this repo.
